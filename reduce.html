  <p>Individuals can take various steps to fight global warming, such as reducing their carbon footprints, promoting education and contacting elected officials. International governments and cities can lead the charge, however, and the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris will hopefully be a turning point.<br>Here are five ways to reduce your carbon footprint.
<ul><li>Going zero waste is a great step towards combating climate change.</li><li>bike more and drive less</li><li>conserve water and protect our waterways</li><li>eat seasonally, locally, and more plants</li><li>switch to sustainable, clean energy</li>
</ul>
<br>Companies and corporations can adopt best practices and refuse to use timber and paper suppliers that contribute to deforestation. In the same vein, conscious consumers can refuse to patronize companies that do, and put pressure on retailers that employ unsustainable manufacturing methods. Individuals can also participate in land preservation through charities and private corporations. Ultimately, however, international governments need to enact stronger, scientific forest protection laws.

<h2>What is Hong Kong doing to combat this?</h2>
<p>As part of China the city is a signatory of the 2016 Paris Agreement to tackle the world’s environmental crisis.<br>The Paris Agreement, which came into force on 4 November 2016, applies to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) as well. As part of China, the HKSAR has the duty to make its contribution in order to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement calls upon the Parties to cooperate with the private sector, civil society, financial institutions, cities and regions in order to mobilise stronger and more ambitious climate actions in the world.<br>Hong Kong’s Environment Bureau published a Climate Action Plan 2030+ in 2017 that establishes how it will reduce its carbon emissions by 2030.<br>The government’s aim is to reduce the city’s carbon footprint by 26 to 36 per cent over the next 10 years. Broadly speaking, these mitigation efforts include using cleaner fuel, renewable energy, and increasing sustainability and efficiency in urban areas and transport.<br>Just 1 per cent of Hong Kong’s electricity comes from renewable sources, and the government says the city can only stretch to about 3 or 4 per cent.
The government has also urged the public to do its share in combating climate change. Otherwise, the extremes we have seen both locally and across the world are predicted to get worse.
