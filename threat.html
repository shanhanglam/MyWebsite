  <p>Many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
    <br><br>Ice is melting worldwide, especially at the Earth’s poles. This includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering West Antarctica and Greenland, and Arctic sea ice. In Montana's Glacier National Park the number of glaciers has declined to fewer than 30 from more than 150 in 1910.
    <br><br>Much of this melting ice contributes to sea-level rise. Global sea levels are rising 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year, and the rise is occurring at a faster rate in recent years.
    <br><br>Rising temperatures are affecting wildlife and their habitats. Vanishing ice has challenged species such as the Adélie penguin in Antarctica, where some populations on the western peninsula have collapsed by 90 percent or more.
    <br><br>As temperatures change, many species are on the move. Some butterflies, foxes, and alpine plants have migrated farther north or to higher, cooler areas.
    <br><br>Precipitation (rain and snowfall) has increased across the globe, on average. Yet some regions are experiencing more severe drought, increasing the risk of wildfires, lost crops, and drinking water shortages.
    <br><br>Some species—including mosquitoes, ticks, jellyfish, and crop pests—are thriving. Booming populations of bark beetles that feed on spruce and pine trees, for example, have devastated millions of forested acres in the U.S.
    <br><br>Climate change refers to the change in climate as a result of human activities that cause a change in the atmosphere’s composition, in addition to natural climate variability. Human activities cause an increase in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, mainly through burning of fossil fuels. The greenhouse gases act like a blanket in the atmosphere, trapping heat on Earth and keeping our planet warm. However, the human-induced increase in greenhouse gases has enhanced the greenhouse effect and caused the climate system to warm – a phenomenon commonly called global warming. This general rise in temperature in turn leads to a proliferation of other problems, such as more frequent heat waves, change in precipitation, rise of sea level, reduction in agricultural production, scarcity of water resource, spread of disease, loss of ecological and environmental balance, etc.

  <h1>Global Warming In Hong Kong</h1>
     <p>In line with the global trend, Hong Kong has been warming up in the last century or so. The number of hot nights is increasing while the number of cold days is decreasing. Apart from rising temperature, Hong Kong experiences more frequent heavy rain than before. The sea level is rising in Victoria Harbour.
     </p>
  <h1>Where does Hong Kong stand in all this?</h1>
  <p>In the summer of 2017, five typhoon 8 warnings were issued, including the record-breaking Typhoon Hato. Earlier that year, Hong Kong was engulfed in a fog that concealed the city’s famous skyline, with visibility dropping to just 500 metres.
    <br><br>In March 2014 the city was hit by hailstones the size of golf balls – some of which smashed through the roof of Festival Walk shopping centre in Kowloon Tong.
    <br><br>The city’s changing climate is consistent with shifting patterns around the world. A humid subtropical climate, Hong Kong’s winter is mild, averaging 16 degrees in January, and summers are sticky, hot and rainy. But the onslaught of a warming planet has pushed the weather to extremes in recent years.
    <br><br>Our meteorological records date back to 1884. The lowest recorded temperature is minus 6 degrees at Tai Mo Shan in January 2016, and the highest 39 degrees in Tin Shui Wai in August 2017.<br>The increased moisture in the air, coupled with warming seas, raises the city’s humidity, the chances of heavy downpours and the frequency of tropical cyclones.
    <br><br>Officials predict that Hong Kong’s sea levels will increase by one metre by the end of the century, making typhoons an even bigger threat in our daily lives. Higher sea levels will also make the storm surges that come with typhoons worse, causing low-lying areas of the city to flood more often.
