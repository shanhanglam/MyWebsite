<body>
  <p>Throughout its long history, Earth has warmed and cooled time and again.
    <br>Climate has changed when the planet received more or less sunlight due to subtle shifts in its orbit,
    <br>as the atmosphere or surface changed, or when the Sun’s energy varied. But in the past century, another force has started to influence Earth’s climate: humanity.
